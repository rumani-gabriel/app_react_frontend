# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm install --save styled-components`

Visual primitives for the component age.
Use the best bits of ES6 and CSS to style your apps without stress.


### `npm install react-router-dom`
React Router is a library to manage routes in applications that use ReactJS. It is inspired by the Ember routing system. js.


### `npm install react-scroll`
Smooth scrolling is one of those features that can add a lot of aesthetic value to your application. The react-scroll package allows you to take advantage of this feature without significant effort.


### `npm install react-icons --save`
Include popular icons in your React projects easily with react-icons, which utilizes ES6 imports that allows you to include only the icons that your project is using.

### `npm install axios`
Axios is a library that helps us make http requests to external resources. In our React applications we often need to retrieve data from external APIs so it can be displayed in our web pages.

### `npm install react-cookie`
A polyfill to allow use of the Cookie Store API in modern browsers that don't support it natively, including IE11. Also compatible with TypeScript.

### `npm install emailjs`
works with SSL and TLS smtp servers
supports smtp authentication ('PLAIN', 'LOGIN', 'CRAM-MD5', 'XOAUTH2')
emails are queued and the queue is sent asynchronously
supports sending html emails and emails with multiple attachments (MIME)
attachments can be added as strings, streams or file paths
supports utf-8 headers and body
built-in type declarations
automatically handles greylisting
### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
